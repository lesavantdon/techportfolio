            Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies and scientific
            discoveries. I spend my free time creating and listening to music,
            painting, sketching and 3D modeling with blender. I am an avid
            enthusiast of ayurvedic nutrition, architecture, painting, music,
            art, cars, motorcycles. I also enjoy badminton, surfing, reading,
            exercising, camping, and spending time with family.
